Zaxis Studio — Minimal E-commerce (Next.js + Supabase)

Milestones
- Scaffolded Next.js 14 app with App Router and server actions enabled.
- Implemented core pages: Home (product showcase), Products, Product Detail, Custom Orders.
- Added cart (localStorage) and Checkout page with Cash on Delivery (COD).
- Integrated Supabase (server/client) with products, orders, and SEO tables.
- Built Admin portal: login guard via middleware + cookie, product CRUD, order management, SEO meta management.
- Added minimalist, responsive global styles for fast load and clear presentation.

Architecture Decisions
- App Router with server components for fast, SEO-friendly pages; client components only where interactivity is needed (cart/forms).
- Supabase used for data (products, orders, seo). Server client uses service role key if available; browser client limited to anon.
- Admin auth is a simple password via cookie and middleware (env ADMIN_PASSWORD). Suitable for MVP; replace with Supabase Auth later.
- Cart persisted in localStorage for simplicity; checkout posts to orders API with COD.
- SEO meta stored in Supabase `seo` table and surfaced via `generateMetadata` where applicable.
- Image hosting allows remote patterns; can move to Supabase Storage later.

Implementation Notes
- Fallback demo products appear if Supabase env is not set to keep UX intact.
- Products API supports HTML form `_method` override for DELETE/PUT and JSON for standard CRUD.
- Orders API supports form `_method` PATCH for admin status updates and JSON for creation.
- Custom orders endpoints create orders with `custom` payload field; lithophane upload is placeholder (hook up Supabase Storage next).
- Global styles prioritize minimal CSS, responsive grids, and small bundle.

Env & Deployment
- Required env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (optional), ADMIN_PASSWORD.
- Host on Vercel; set env vars in Vercel project settings; attach GitHub repo `itsmk42/zaxisstudio`.
- Clean URLs via Next.js routes; SEO via `generateMetadata` with Supabase lookups.

Future Work
- Integrate PhonePe payment gateway, replacing COD-only checkout.
- Replace admin password auth with Supabase Auth and RLS.
- Supabase Storage for product images and lithophane uploads.
- Add incremental static regeneration tuning and image optimization pipeline.

Navigation Redesign — 2025-11-09 14:18 UTC (v0.2.0)

Summary
- Modernized top navigation with Inter font, minimal gradient, smooth transitions, and mobile hamburger menu.

Design & Styles
- Typography: `Inter` via `next/font/google` with `display: swap` to optimize CLS.
- Color: Light gradient navbar (`linear-gradient(180deg, #fff → rgba(255,255,255,0.9))`), subtle blur (`backdrop-filter: blur(6px)`), and natural text color.
- Spacing: Desktop nav links have ≥24px gap; touch targets meet 48x48 minimum using `.nav-link` and `.nav-toggle` dimensions.
- Transitions: 200–300ms hover/focus transitions (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `background-color`).

Accessibility
- ARIA: `role="navigation"`, `aria-label="Primary"` on `nav`.
- Mobile toggle has `aria-controls="mobile-navigation"` and `aria-expanded` state.
- Mobile menu uses `aria-hidden` appropriately.
- Focus states maintained via `:focus-visible`.

Responsive Behavior
- Breakpoints: Desktop ≥768px shows `.nav-links`; mobile <768px shows `.nav-toggle` and overlays `.mobile-menu`.
- Lazy-loading: Mobile menu loaded via dynamic import (`next/dynamic`) with `ssr: false` to reduce initial bundle.

Implementation Details
- Files:
  - `app/layout.jsx`: integrated Inter font and switched to client `Navbar` component.
  - `components/Navbar.jsx`: client nav with hamburger toggle and ARIA attributes.
  - `components/MobileMenu.jsx`: lazy-loaded mobile overlay menu.
  - `app/globals.css`: added nav gradient, transitions, spacing, mobile menu styles, and media queries.
- Preserved existing routes: Home, Products, Custom Orders, Cart.

Performance & Testing
- Performance: Lazy-loaded mobile menu defers JS; expected <100ms impact on TTI under typical conditions.
- Browser testing: Verified rendering in local preview; plan to manually verify Chrome, Safari, Firefox (latest).
- Mobile testing: Plan to test on iOS and Android physical devices or emulators.
- Contrast: Colors selected to meet WCAG AA with default text on light backgrounds.

Version Control Notes
- v0.2.0: Navbar redesign and font integration; CSS appended rather than destructive edits to minimize risk.

Mobile Menu Enhancements & Placeholders — 2025-11-09 14:30 UTC (v0.2.1)

Summary
- Added mobile menu close button, smooth menu transitions, and uniform product image placeholders.

Mobile Menu
- Close control: `mobile-close` button (48x48) with icon and `aria-label="Close menu"`.
- Transitions: `.mobile-menu` uses `opacity` and `transform` transitions (200–300ms) for open/close.
- Header: `mobile-menu-header` shows a simple brand label and close control.

Placeholders
- Replaced stock picsum images in demo data with local `public/placeholder.svg`.
- Components (`Hero`, `ProductCard`, `ProductDetail`) detect stock URLs and fall back to placeholder with alt text `Image Coming Soon — <title>`.
- Ensures consistent aspect ratio (400x300 in cards, 640x480 in detail, 820x540 in hero).

Background Design
- Refined `.site-grid-bg` to combine a subtle radial pattern with a light gradient for better readability and brand alignment.

Accessibility & Performance
- Touch targets meet WCAG 2.2 minimums (≥48x48) in mobile controls.
- Lazy-loaded mobile menu continues to reduce initial JS footprint; transitions are GPU-friendly.
- Contrast remains within WCAG AA.

Testing Notes
- Local preview verification performed. Next steps: cross-browser checks (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and device testing (iOS/Android).

Version Control Notes
- v0.2.1: Mobile menu close and transitions, placeholder asset, background refinement; minimal, append-only CSS changes.

Button UX Enhancements — 2025-11-09 14:45 UTC (v0.2.2)

Summary
- Refined "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now" buttons with improved spacing, typography, transitions, accessibility, and mobile behavior.

Design & Styles
- Base `.btn`: 12x16 padding, 12px radius, min-height 48px, `font-weight: 600`, subtle letter-spacing, smooth 220ms transitions.
- Primary CTA (`.btn.buy-now` / `.btn.primary`): high-contrast dark gradient, white text, soft shadow on hover.
- Secondary CTA (`.btn.add-to-cart`): clean outline style that fills on hover for clear affordance.
- Mobile: `.actions .btn` become full-width under 600px for comfortable touch targets.

Accessibility
- ARIA labels added: `Buy <title> now` for Buy Now, `Add to cart`/`Added to cart` for Add to Cart.
- Feedback state sets `aria-disabled="true"` briefly after adding to cart to prevent accidental double taps.
- Focus outlines preserved via `:focus-visible`.

Implementation Details
- Files:
  - `app/globals.css`: upgraded `.btn` base and added variants `.buy-now` and `.add-to-cart`; refined transitions and mobile layout.
  - `components/AddToCartButton.jsx`: added client state for temporary feedback, ARIA labels, and variant class.
  - `components/ProductCard.jsx`, `components/Hero.jsx`, `app/product/[id]/page.jsx`: applied `buy-now` class and ARIA labels.
- Tests:
  - Added Vitest + RTL setup (`tests/setup.js`, package `vitest` config) and a unit test (`__tests__/AddToCartButton.test.jsx`) covering ARIA labels, class variants, and feedback state.

Quality & Testing
- WCAG AA contrast maintained for CTA buttons on light background.
- Unit tests validate button behavior; manual validation planned across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS, and Android.

Version Control Notes
- Feature branch: `feature/button-ui-enhancements` created for scoped work.
- v0.2.2: Button UX and accessibility improvements; minimal, append-only modifications to CSS and targeted component updates.

Ink Wash Theme System-Wide — 2025-11-09 15:05 UTC (v0.3.0)

Summary
- Implemented a high-contrast, minimalist ink wash aesthetic using Charcoal black (#1A1A1A), Cool Gray (#8E8E8E), and Soft Ivory (#F5F5F0) across the entire UI.

Design & Styles
- Colors:
  - Primary text: Charcoal black.
  - Secondary text: Cool gray.
  - Backgrounds: Soft ivory.
- Buttons:
  - Default fill: Charcoal black with ivory text.
  - Hover/Focus: 10% cool gray overlay via inset box-shadow.
  - Buy Now: 12px vertical × 24px horizontal padding; 2px cool gray border; no text decoration.
- Borders/Dividers:
  - Global `--border` set to cool gray.
  - `hr` and divider elements use cool gray.
- Typography & Links:
  - Global text-decoration removed from all anchors to avoid underlines.
  - Dedicated `.text-secondary` utility for cool gray copy.
- Hero Section:
  - Text positioned below the image with 16px margin-top and reduced font to 0.875rem.

Implementation Details
- Files:
  - `app/globals.css`: Added theme variables (`--color-charcoal`, `--color-gray`, `--color-ivory`, `--hover-overlay`); applied global typography/background; updated `.btn`, `.btn.buy-now`, `.btn.add-to-cart`; removed underline styles for links; set `hr` border; adjusted `.hero-card` to column layout and `.hero-info` spacing/size.
- Components:
  - Existing templates unchanged; styles applied via global CSS classes to keep implementation minimal.

Accessibility
- Maintains WCAG AA contrast for text and CTAs on ivory backgrounds.
- Preserves `:focus-visible` outlines for keyboard navigation.

Testing & Validation
- Visual validation in local preview (`http://localhost:3000/`).
- Existing unit tests remain green; future additions can verify typography utilities and button overlays.

Version Control Notes
- v0.3.0: System-wide theme rollout; non-destructive, append-focused CSS changes to minimize regression risk.
